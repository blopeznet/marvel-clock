# Marvel Comics Cover Slideshow & Clock

This project is a comic cover slideshow and clock that can be used as a screensaver. It leverages the Marvel API to display random comic covers with dynamic filters for a personalized experience. This project is part of my portfolio and was created for the pleasure of developing a creative solution that utilizes the Marvel APIâ€”no monetary or income-generating purpose.

## Key Features

- **Comic Cover Slideshow**: Displays a rotating selection of comic book covers.
- **Custom Filters**: Filter comics by year range, character, and result limit.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Comic cover images appear as backgrounds in the interface.
- **Clock**: Displays the current time in the app for a screensaver effect.
- **Marvel API Integration**: Uses the Marvel API to fetch comic cover data in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3 + Vite**: For fast, modern front-end development using Vue's `<script setup>` syntax.
- **Pinia**: State management to handle UI state and API data.
- **Axios**: To fetch data from the Marvel API.
- **md5**: For secure hashing to meet Marvel API requirements.
- **localStorage**: Saves user settings (filters, selected characters) to retain preferences between sessions.
